A stupid Ruby project by ry00001  

## Why?
I wanna learn Ruby.  

## How do I run it?
Are you *sure* you want to?  

### Yes
Are you *really, really* sure you want to???

### Yes!
Fine...  
Make a new file called `config.json`.  
In it, type:  
```json
{
    "token": "Your token here. Get one from https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me. Make sure to not share this with anyone!",
    "version": 0.1,
    "prefixes": ["<A list of Regular Expressions to act as prefixes/suffixes. The only capturing group is the command."],
    "owner": [A list of user IDs *AS NUMBERS!*]
}
```
After you've done that, open a terminal window and type `bundle install`. If it says it can't find bundle, type `gem install bundler`.  
After bundler has done its thing, start it by typing `ruby bot.rb`.

## Who made this?
Me, @ry00001, with help from @Seriell and @TrenchFroast.
